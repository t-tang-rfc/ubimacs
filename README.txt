OS-wide Emacs/macOS keymapping for Ubuntu.

This configuration remaps keys in a way that is consistent with Emacs and macOS keybindings, making it easier for users familiar with those environments to work in Ubuntu.

Requires `python3-evdev` package.
Note, if you are using Ubuntu 24.04, you will need to install it via `apt` instead of `pip`.
